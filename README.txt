== Introduction ==

To make a reservation a visitor or client must enter the page of a accommodation, choose the dates of check-in and check-out, complete the form and press the "Preview booking" button.

The next screen is "Preview of the booking" where the visitor or client can see details of the reservation, such as the price and if a Promotion applies.
Finally, clicking on the "Confirm booking" button will go to the screen where a "Reservation received" message will be displayed.
At that moment a new reservation is generated in the "Pending" status and two emails will be sent, one to the client and another to the reservation system administrator.

When the reservation manager changes the status of the reservation from "Pending" to "Confirmed" or to "Canceled" a notification email will also be sent to the client.
